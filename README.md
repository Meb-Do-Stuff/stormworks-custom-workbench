# How to install
Before everything: It's better to clone your current tiles forlder (or you can get the default workbench by using tags on this github)

You have to go to `{stormworks-installation-folder}\rom\data\tiles`

Replace the files in the folder with those I have made available (keep what I have not yet made available)

<h3>You can use World View for have a good view of the world</h3>
